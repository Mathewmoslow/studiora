# Enhanced Parser Backup - June 6, 2025

This backup contains the enhanced parser system with domain-specific configurations.

## What's Included:
- **EnhancedScheduleParser.js**: Extended version of ScheduleParser with improved pattern matching
- **EnhancedStudiorAIService.js**: Extended AI service with domain awareness
- **config/DocumentTypeConfigs.js**: Domain-specific configurations (nursing, CS, business, etc.)
- **StudioraDualParser-with-enhancements.js**: The version that uses all these enhancements

## Why We Reverted:
- The base sequential parser was already working well (finding 58 assignments)
- We wanted to stabilize the base system before adding complexity
- The enhancements can be reintroduced gradually once the foundation is solid

## How to Restore:
1. Copy these files back to src/services/
2. Update StudioraDualParser.js to use Enhanced versions
3. The enhanced versions inherit from base classes, so they're non-destructive
