echo "2. 🚀 START DEVELOPMENT SERVER"
echo "   npm run dev"
echo ""
echo "3. 📱 OPEN IN VS CODE"
echo "   code ."
echo ""
echo "4. 🌐 CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY"
echo "   Go to github.com and create a new repository named 'studiora'"
echo "   Then run:"
echo "   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/studiora.git"
echo "   git branch -M main"
echo "   git push -u origin main"
echo ""
echo "5. 🧪 TEST THE DUAL PARSER"
echo "   - Start the dev server (npm run dev)"
echo "   - Click 'Import Course' in the UI"
echo "   - Paste sample nursing content like:"
echo "   \"Module 1: Women's Health"
echo "   - Read Chapter 1-3 by Friday"
echo "   - Quiz on cardiovascular system next Monday"
echo "   - Come prepared to discuss fetal development\""

echo "📚 PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS:"
echo "- ✅ Complete regex parser extracted from your existing code"
echo "- ✅ Full AI service with independent parsing + reconciliation"
echo "- ✅ Elegant dual parser engine with intelligent flow"
echo "- ✅ Modern React UI with Tailwind styling"
echo "- ✅ Nursing education optimized (OB/GYN, Adult Health, NCLEX, Gerontology)"
echo "- ✅ Progressive enhancement: Regex results → AI enhancement"
echo "- ✅ Always-on AI validation regardless of regex confidence"
echo ""
echo "🔍 TESTING THE PARSER:"
echo "The dual parser is designed to:"
echo "1. Run regex parsing independently (fast results ~50ms)"
echo "2. Run AI parsing independently (enhanced results ~2-3s)"
echo "3. Use AI to reconcile differences intelligently"
echo "4. Provide confidence scoring based on agreement"
echo "5. Show transparent results about what each parser found"
